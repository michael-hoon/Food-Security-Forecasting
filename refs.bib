abstract = {Continuing population and consumption growth will mean that the global demand for food will increase for at least another 40 years. Growing competition for land, water, and energy, in addition to the overexploitation of fisheries, will affect our ability to produce food, as will the urgent requirement to reduce the impact of the food system on the environment. The effects of climate change are a further threat. But the world can produce more food and can ensure that it is used more efficiently and equitably. A multifaceted and linked global strategy is needed to ensure sustainable and equitable food security, different components of which are explored here.}}

 abstract = {In the standard linear regression model with independent, homoscedastic errors, the Gauss-Markov theorem asserts that Î²Ì‚, = (X'X)-1(X'y) is the best linear unbiased estimator of Î² and, furthermore, that c'Î²Ì‚ is the best linear unbiased estimator of c'Î² for all p Ã— 1 vectors c. In the corresponding random regressor model, X is a random sample of size n from a p-variate distribution. If attention is restricted to linear estimators of c'Î² that are conditionally unbiased, given X, the Gauss-Markov theorem applies. If, however, the estimator is required only to be unconditionally unbiased, the Gauss-Markov theorem may or may not hold, depending on what is known about the distribution of X. The results generalize to the case in which X is a random sample without replacement from a finite population.},

 abstract = {This paper is concerned with the estimation of covariance matrices in the presence of heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation of unknown forms. Currently available estimators that are designed for this context depend upon the choice of a lag truncation parameter and a weighting scheme. Results in the literature provide a condition on the growth rate of the lag truncation parameter as T → ∞ that is sufficient for consistency. No results are available, however, regarding the choice of lag truncation parameter for a fixed sample size, regarding data-dependent automatic lag truncation parameters, or regarding the choice of weighting scheme. In consequence, available estimators are not entirely operational and the relative merits of the estimators are unknown. This paper addresses these problems. The asymptotic truncated mean squared errors of estimators in a given class are determined and compared. Asymptotically optimal kernel/weighting scheme and bandwidth/lag truncation parameters are obtained using an asymptotic truncated mean squared error criterion. Using these results, data-dependent automatic bandwidth/lag truncation parameters are introduced. The finite sample properties of the estimators are analyzed via Monte Carlo simulation.},

abstract="This chapter considers a more general variance covariance matrix for the disturbances. In other words, assumption 1 is relaxed so that u {\textasciitilde} (0,$\sigma$2$\Omega$) where $\Omega$ is a positive definite matrix of dimension (nxn). First $\Omega$ is assumed known and the BLUE for $\beta$ is derived. This estimator turns out to be different from {\$}{\$}{\{}{\backslash}hat {\backslash}beta {\_}{\{}ols{\}}{\}}{\$}{\$}, and is denoted by {\$}{\$}{\{}{\backslash}hat {\backslash}beta {\_}{\{}GLS{\}}{\}}{\$}{\$}, the generalized least squares estimator of $\beta$. Therefore, we study the properties of {\$}{\$}{\{}{\backslash}hat {\backslash}beta {\_}{\{}ols{\}}{\}}{\$}{\$}under this non-spherical form of the disturbances. Section 9.3 studies some special structures of $\Omega$ and derive the corresponding BLUE for $\beta$. Section 9.4 introduces normality and derives the maximum likelihood estimator. Sections 9.5 and 9.6 study the way in which test of hypothesis and prediction get affected by this general variance-covariance assumption on the disturbances. Section 9.7 studies the properties of this BLUE for $\beta$ when $\Omega$ is unknown, and is replaced by a consistent estimator. Section 9.8 studies what happens to the W, LR and LM statistics when u {\textasciitilde} N(0,$\sigma$2$\Omega$).",
